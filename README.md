1. Notification Reminder:
This Python program utilizes the Plyer library to create a simple notification reminder. Users can set a specific time for the notification to appear and choose how long it will remain visible on the screen. The program allows customization, enabling users to specify the reminder time and duration based on their preferences. Once the set time arrives, the program triggers a notification to alert the user, ensuring they stay on track with their schedule or tasks.

Key features:
Customizable Time: Set the time at which the notification should be triggered.
Duration Control: Choose how long the notification remains visible on the screen.
Plyer Library: Uses the Plyer library to generate platform-independent notifications.
This program is a useful tool for task management or reminders, offering flexibility in terms of both timing and notification duration.

2. Bakery Management System (BMS):
This Python-based Bakery Management System allows customers to place orders from a pre-defined menu. The system offers a simple       interface to select items from a list of bakery products, automatically calculating the total cost of the order.

Key Features:
Menu Management: A set menu with items like pizza, pasta, burger, salad, and coffee, each assigned a specific price.
Order Input: Customers can choose their items by entering the name of the product they wish to order.
Order Validation: The system checks whether the chosen item is available on the menu. If the item is available, it is added to the order; if not, the customer is informed that the item is unavailable.
Multiple Orders: Customers can place multiple orders. After selecting an initial item, they can decide to add more items to the order.
Order Total Calculation: The system keeps a running total of the items selected, providing the final amount at the end of the order.

Workflow:
1.The customer is greeted and shown the available menu.
2.They can choose an item to add to their order.
3.If they wish, they can add more items to the order.
4.At the end, the total amount of the order is displayed.
5.This simple program is ideal for small-scale bakery operations, allowing easy management of customer orders and quick calculation of the total amount.
